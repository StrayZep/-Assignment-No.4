 On hw4 we are supposed to sue Bootstrap to enhance our pervious simple web of hw2, since the pdf says we are allowed to use online template, I used a template from GitHub, which is totally open source and free.
 Here is the template link:
 https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-resume 
It was designed for personal resume, I found it was also suitable to modify for homework showcase.Its a big template, so I just change and use the part where I need.

 It includes a function called smooth scrolling made by javascript, it can make web looks better when user scroll up or down.


 the purpose of my web is for showing every homework that I did in this course, and on my homework 2, it was too trivial and lack sense of design, I used couple blocks to make web ordered well and user can easily and quickly click the content what they want to see. The most function can learned form our inclass3 exercise, especially the function that it can automatically change navigation when we resize the browser to thin width, this is same like inclass exercise. This web is also working perfectly on mobile device, the content will adjust its position for better point of view on small screen.
